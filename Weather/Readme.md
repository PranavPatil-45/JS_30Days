# Weather Web Application 🌤️

## Overview
This project is a simple **Weather Web Application** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It simulates weather conditions like temperature, wind, rain, and sun animations — **without using any external API**.  
The goal is to demonstrate front-end skills such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and creative design.

## Features
- 🌡️ Display basic weather conditions (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, Windy, etc.)
- 🎨 Dynamic background and icon changes based on weather
- ⏲️ Simulated weather changes (pre-programmed, randomized, or user-selected)
- 💻 Responsive and lightweight design
- ⚡ Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks or libraries

## How It Works
- The app uses a **predefined set of weather data** (hardcoded or randomly generated).
- When a user interacts (e.g., click a button or select a weather type), the displayed weather updates accordingly.
- Weather visuals are created using CSS animations and JavaScript DOM updates.

## Project Structure
```
/weather-app
  ├── index.html
  ├── style.css
  ├── script.js
  └── README.md
```

- `index.html` — Structure of the app
- `style.css` — Styling and animations
- `script.js` — Weather logic and interactions
- `README.md` — Project documentation

## Installation
No installation needed!  
Just **download** or **clone** this repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-web-app.git
cd weather-web-app
open index.html
```

## Usage
- Open the web app in your browser.
- Select or trigger different weather conditions.
- Watch the background and icons change accordingly!

## Future Improvements 🚀
- Add a clock and dynamic day/night cycle.
- Allow users to manually "set" temperature values.
- Improve animations with more complex CSS or Canvas elements.
- (Optional) Add offline storage of user settings.
